       <h3>The best movies according to John.</h3>
        <h4>My top 3 movies of all times</h4>
        <hr/>
     
    <h5>Missing</h5>
    <p> What I loved about this movie was that the main character was totally insane, 
    she did a lot of terrible different things, I expected her to be a psyco but not like 
    that, and I wasn't expecting her to get away with everything she did.</p>
    <h5>The lovely bones</h5>
    <p>This movie broke my hearth, it was about a little girl who was killed by her teacher
    the teacher killed her becaue he was abusing her and he was affraid of somene
    else fnding out about it and getting caught. The girls father started inestigating and 
    at the end he was able to reveal the thruth about his 
    daughter's murder.</p>
    <h5>In Time.</h5>
    <p>This movie is amazing becasue it shows that money and time are the most valuable
    things. This movie particularly I loved it becasue it highlights the unequality of
    society and the power that rich people have over everything.
