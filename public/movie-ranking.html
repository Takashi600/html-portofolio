    <p> What I loved about this movie was that the main character was totally insane, 
    she did a lot of terrible different things, I expected her to be a psyco but not like 
    that, and I wasn't expecting her to get away with everything she did.</p>

    <p>This movie is amazing becasue it shows that money and time are the most valuable
    things. This movie particularly I loved it becasue it highlights the unequality of
    society and the power that rich people have over everything.
